          <p>Originally named Scanland Consulting, the company was founded after 26 years of serving nonprofit organizations in numerous capacities. Patricia Scanland made a decision to fulfill her career-long wish of starting a consulting practice to work with nonprofits, ministries, schools/colleges, governmental entities, and small businesses to empower them to build their capacity and achieve success.</p><br>
          <p>Scanland Consulting grew from an idea for a Center for Nonprofit Effectiveness. It became clear that nonprofits had inherent weaknesses that hindered their ability to fulfill their missions, achieve their visions, and secure the financial support needed to remain strong in the short term and sustainable over the long term.</p><br>
          <p>There was also a misguided notion that nonprofits should accomplish great work with very limited resources, minimal staff compensation, and still maintain long-term effectiveness.</p><br>
          <p>After almost 25 years, Scanland Consulting transformed into The Scanland Group.</p>
